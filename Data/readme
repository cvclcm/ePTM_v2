Hydrodynamic data was generated using DWR-DSM2 and OpenFOAM

2D acoustic tracking studies conducted on Chinook salmon and Steelhead at the Head of Old River and Georgiana Slough were used in this project. This data includes acoustic tracking of fish as well as ADCP near-surface water velocities obtained by USGS, USFWS, DWR and AECOM Ltd. The data is hosted by DWR.
